I have transferred the knowledge I gained from the Python course at Marymount University and online courses. For example, I am familiar with writing a program that requests users to input a word or password. We wrote a code that created a list, that specified a grocery list, and we asked users to input their desired groceries. Therefore, I used this example to write a script that askes users to write their password for analysis. I encountered only a simple syntax error when typing the word "pass" in my code. That said, my program worked perfectly. From this practice, I learned that this script allows users to examine if their password has been leaked or not by processing and analyzing the link to verify the status of the password.
### Example Output:
Please enter the first password for processing:123456
Please enter the second password for processing:rhhfhh3hh3h3
The password is found in: 127931282 = leaks. You should consider changing the password.

The password rhhfhh3hh3h3 is not found in the breaches database.
